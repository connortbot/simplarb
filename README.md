SimplArb pulls games from across the world, across every major profession league, and the best arbitrage bets to make.
Using theOdds API, SimplArb searches hundreds of Casinos and Sportsbooks around the world, and compiles the best, most profitable bets cleanly and quickly for every game around the world in any pro level.

NOTE: This is not endorsing nor encouraging illegal casino/sportsbook access. Note that in Canada+many US states, many quality sportsbooks have age restrictions AND/OR region restrictions. As far as I know, VPN use will get you banned, and may be illegal.
Just because SimplArb shows a platform as the best bet, it does not necessarily mean it is legal for you, the user. It finds the BEST.

The BANNED_PLATFORMS tag can be changed to get rid of sites you know you cannot access.

There are some filter options, such as filtering to the US, or the EU, etc. 
You can also choose to only view upcoming games (recommended) in any sport/league. In each game, it'll analyze:
- If there is an existing arbitrage
- The max potential profit
- The optimal bets on Home Team, Away Team, and Draw (e.g football/soccer, but not NFL), including their odds and on which platform.
